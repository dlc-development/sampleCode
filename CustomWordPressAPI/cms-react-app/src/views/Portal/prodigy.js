                        <h3>Can I change my student loan amount after accepting my conditional offer?</h3>
                        <p>You can change your loan amount after youâ€™ve received and accepted conditional approval from us.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Reducing your loan amount</strong> <br />
                            You can reduce your Prodigy Finance loan amount any time before you sign the final loan agreement, which happens when you arrive on campus for the start of class. And, the administration fee will also be reduced accordingly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Increasing your loan amount</strong> <br />
                            You may also request an increase in your Prodigy Finance loan amount; however, it isnâ€™t guaranteed. Our the Prodigy Finance committee will need to approve your new loan amount. Keep in mind that the associated admin fee will also increase.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 className='mt-5'>How do Prodigy Finance loan interest rates work?</h3>
                        <p>There are 3 different types of interest rates that apply to your Prodigy loan. But, itâ€™s critical that while they all apply, theyâ€™re not separate interest rates; theyâ€™re different ways of looking at your interest costs.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Simple interest rate</strong> <br />
                            This is the interest rate you receive for your loan, plus the Euribor / Libor base rate, which varies every 3 months. For example, if you receive a loan offer of â‚¬40 000 at 7.2%, and the 3 month Euribor is 0.12%, your simple interest rate is 7.32% (7.2% + 0.12%). One twelfth (1/12) of this is added to your account balance at the end of each month.</li>
                        <li><strong>Annual effective interest rate</strong> <br />
                        The effective interest rate (EIR) also includes the effect of compounding during your study and grace periods (where you arenâ€™t making payments). For this example, the EIR is 7.62%.</li>
                        <li><strong>APR (annual percentage rate)</strong> <br />
                        While the EIR takes the effect of compounding into account, the APR also takes all fees associated with your loan (ie, administration fees) into account. For this example, the APR of your Prodigy loan would be 8.09%.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Students who are considering different loan options should use the APR for the purposes of comparison.</p>


                        <h3 className='mt-5'>When do the funds get disbursed?</h3>
                        <p>Disbursement dates of Prodigy Finance loans vary from school to school. And, you can rest assured that Prodigy Finance is in continuous communication with every school, and we have agreements in place that allow students to defer payment until the date on which the funds are disbursed. Please note that Prodigy Finance loans cannot be used to pay any acceptance deposits or reservation fees required to secure your place at your school.</p>


                        <h3 className='mt-5'>What can I use the funds for?</h3>
                        <p>Some schools allow funds to be used for living expenses as well as tuition fees. If your loan includes living expenses, we will send all funds to your school. Once tuition fees are paid the school will then transfer living expense funds to you directly. In this case, it is best to reach out to your school's Financial Aid Office to coordinate the times and dates.</p>


                        <h3 className='mt-5'>How long does it take for my funds to reach my school?</h3>
                        <p>Once you have signed your loan agreement and Prodigy Finance has released your funds, it takes between 3 to 5 business days for the funds to arrive in your schoolâ€™s account.</p>
                        <p>You'll need to allow a few extra days to give your school's admin department the opportunity to allocate our payment to your student account.</p>

                        <h3 className='mt-5'>What happens if I repay my loan early?</h3>
                        <p>You donâ€™t need to make any repayments during the grace period (which lasts for six months after you graduate). However, there are no charges or penalties if you do decide to make early repayments or settle your loan early. Want to start repaying your loan while youâ€™re still studying? No worries there either.</p>
